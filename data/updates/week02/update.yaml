**What you've accomplished since the last update, and whether you met last week's goals (or why not). 
Please restate your goals from last week. Part of your grade this week will be whether you addressed goals from last week. **

- Pivoted the idea of the application to one that simply gets you out of any situation -CCE leaders contended that apps that have no clear relation to issues such as sexual misconduct are the most effective.
- Fixed landing page. This can be found at https://htoyll8.wixsite.com/weconsent.
- Met with Yaleâ€™s community consent educators to discuss the viability and effectiveness of our application.
  - Takeaways:
    - Consent applications have a proclivity for making the concept of consent more complex than it is
       - For example, the quiz can possibly create more problems than solution. How accurate is the quiz in determining consent? Should a multiple choice be used to determine whether someone should consent? The task of taking a multiple choice to determine whether or not someone consents goes against the idea that consent is ongoing.Begun building our MVP: we have created a layout for the call immediately functio
        Last weeks goal were not met due to a misunderstanding of the assignment. Due to the fact we pivoted to a completely a new idea, we believed that our goal was to prove that our new application was viable and a place in the market rather than conduct interviews and create an MVP.
- Our MVP consists of:
  - Quiz page with simple quiz questions
  - Gives the user a glimpse of the application.
  - Next steps, hopefully these are actionable and well-defined goals.
- Set up more interviews
  - more CCE members
  - students across different campuses
  - school administators
  - Figure out how to send a pre-recorded call to the user

** Overview of code **
 
- created HTML and CSS for signup
- created HTML and CSS for emergency call button.

** Media, images, and demonstrations of the key improvements made to your MVP. **

- completed rough draft of the signup form for users. This can be found at [website].
- created a rough draft of the html and css for the emergency buttons
- automatically text a friend
- get a fake call button
- currently working on sending sms messages from application.


** Customer Acquisition Strategies **

- The best tactic for acquiring new customers is content marketing
    - marketing that involves the creation and sharing of online material (such as videos, blogs, and social media posts) that does not explicitly promote a brand but is intended to stimulate interest in its products or services.
      Send customers newletters about application updates
- Outside of direct sales, there is no better business outcome attached to first-time visitors than when they subscribe to receive newsletters and email updates from you.
- Choosing the right words
  - "Choosing the right words is an important part of how your business sells online, so invest a little time in learning about powerful wordsmithing."
