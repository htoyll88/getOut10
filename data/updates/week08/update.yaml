** brief overview of the code that exists so far **
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that makes the site interactive

**What you've accomplished since the last update, and whether you met last week's goals 
(or why not).**
  - Please restate your goals from last week. Part of your grade this week will be whether you addressed goals from last week.
      - Previous goals: 
        - create the visual framework for the application, so user will be able to see it and interact with it.
        - Determine the “quintessential user”
        - Conduct at least 15 interviews 
        - Allow interviewees to test out the MVP
      - Accomplished goals: 
        - Conducted 20 interviews (see the documentation from the brief interviews here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X2pr1eh5lYqtOzHC3qsBRmmya-MiX_3efbd_K1sbupA/edit)
        - Designed code to make the application interactive (see this @: https://github.com/htoyll88/htoyll88.github.io)
        - Restructured the mission of the application
          - The application now strives to simply get users out of any situation with the assistance of an emergency call button. 
          - As an interviewee accentuated, research suggest that the applications and platforms that are most beneficial in regards
           to ameliorating the issue of sexual misconduct are application that do not have any evident connection or correlation with it.
        - **added a demo to webiste (see at: https://htoyll8.wixsite.com/weconsent)** 

**Next steps, hopefully these are actionable and well-defined goals.**

  - Continue working on the visual display of the application
  - Strive to make the application as user-friendly and effective as possible
  - Continue to conduct interviews
  - Get in contact with the administrators on a various campuses across the nation
  - Do they believe the application will be effective?
  - Do they think an application with such a mission is necessary? Does it have a place on their campus?
  - Would they invest in it?
  - What improvement should be made?

**Media, images, and demonstrations of the key improvements made to your MVP.**

  - Made the application interactive and deployed it to a website
  - See the code for the application here: https://htoyll88.github.io

  **Customer acquisition strategies that have been used:** 
    - send newsletters out to subscribers 
      - people recieve newsletters after entering information into the app's website
    - Giving potential customers the chance to engage with the application 
    - conducting several interviews 
      - shows people that their input is valuable
